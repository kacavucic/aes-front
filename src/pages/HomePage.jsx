                                    AES is an electronic signature
                                    solution that uses advanced electronic signature and allows users to manage the
                                    document signing process. It can also be integrated within other
                                    applications through the use of

                                            An <b style={{color: "#47b2e4"}}>electronic signature</b> is a legal concept
                                            that is defined by eIDAS
                                            as <i> data in electronic form which is
                                            attached to
                                            or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used
                                            by the signatory to sign </i> (eIDAS Article 3.10).
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            A <b style={{color: "#47b2e4"}}>digital signature</b>, on the other hand,
                                            refers to a mathematical and
                                            cryptographic concept that is widely used to provide concrete and practical
                                            instances of electronic signature. The definition given by ETSI TR 119 100
                                            is that of <i>data appended to, or a cryptographic transformation of a data
                                            unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and
                                            integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery e.g. by the
                                            recipient.</i>
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            These two concepts should be distinguished, as all electronic signatures are
                                            not necessarily digital signatures.

                                            The eIDAS Regulation defines three levels of electronic signature: 'simple'
                                            electronic signature, advanced electronic signature and qualified electronic
                                            signature. The requirements of each level are built on the requirements of
                                            the level below it, such that a qualified electronic signature meets the
                                            most requirements and a 'simple' electronic signature the least.

                                            <br/>
                                            An electronic signature is defined as "data in electronic form which is
                                            attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and
                                            which is used by the signatory to sign". Thus, something as simple as
                                            writing your name under an e-mail might constitute an electronic signature.
